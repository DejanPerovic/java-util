# Java-Util Converter Roadmap

## üéØ Vision: Best JVM Conversion Library on the Internet

This roadmap tracks strategic enhancements to make java-util the definitive type conversion library for the JVM ecosystem.

## üöÄ Current Optimization Phase (In Progress)

### High Priority Bridge Optimizations
- [ ] Universal toString() Bridge (saves 45+ conversions)
- [ ] Universal toMap() Bridge (saves 35+ conversions) 
- [ ] Atomic ‚Üí Primitive Bridge (saves 70+ conversions)
- [ ] Enhanced getSupportedConversions() with bridge path discovery

### Medium Priority Optimizations
- [ ] AWT Cross-Conversion Bridge (saves 60+ conversions)
- [ ] DateTime ‚Üí Long Bridge (saves 30+ conversions)
- [ ] File/Path bridge completeness verification
- [ ] Buffer Cross-Conversion Bridge (saves 12+ conversions)

**Expected Impact**: ~250 fewer conversion definitions (~30% code reduction) while expanding user-visible conversion space

## üåê Future Type Support Pipeline

### Phase 1: Modern Java (2024-2025)
- [ ] Java 21+ Record Patterns & Sealed Classes
- [ ] Java 22+ String Templates
- [ ] Java 23+ Primitive Collections (IntList, LongList, etc.) - **HIGH IMPACT**
- [ ] Enhanced Pattern Matching types

### Phase 2: Ecosystem Integration (2025)
- [ ] Jakarta EE 9+ types (post-javax migration)
- [ ] Spring Boot 3.x configuration types
- [ ] Kubernetes/cloud-native config objects (ConfigMap, Secret)
- [ ] Modern reactive types (Flow.Publisher, etc.)

### Phase 3: Emerging Technologies (2025-2026)
- [ ] AI/ML vector types (embeddings, matrices)
- [ ] Value types (Project Valhalla - when available)
- [ ] Kotlin Multiplatform interop types
- [ ] Cloud provider SDK common types

## üìä Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Maintain sub-microsecond conversion times for common paths
- Bridge overhead < 2x vs direct conversions
- Memory footprint reduction from fewer conversion definitions

### Coverage Targets  
- Support 95%+ of common DTO/value types in JVM ecosystem
- Zero-dependency remains core principle
- Comprehensive bridge path discovery (1-3 hops)

### Developer Experience
- Clear documentation of available conversion paths
- IDE auto-completion for all supported conversions
- Migration guides for major version updates

## üéØ Competitive Positioning

**vs Jackson ObjectMapper**: Faster, zero dependencies, broader type support
**vs MapStruct**: Runtime flexibility, no code generation required  
**vs ModelMapper**: Performance, zero reflection overhead
**vs Manual mapping**: Complete automation, type safety

## üìù Implementation Notes

- All new types should follow established bridge patterns
- Maintain backward compatibility in public APIs
- Comprehensive test coverage for all conversion paths
- Performance benchmarks for all major additions
